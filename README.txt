Prism is a new lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter, built with modern
web standards in mind. Itâ€™s a spin-off from Dabblet [1] and is tested there daily
by thousands.

This module will provide proper integration with the 3rd-party library, a
simple API for developers, an input filter, and expose all options of this
library via standard Drupal settings forms.

Read more about this library at Prismjs.com [2], also, read this blog post by
Lea Verou [3] introducing it.
